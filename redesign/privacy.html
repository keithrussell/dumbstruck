            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This is the privacy policy for Dumbstruck, a website and application owned and developed by Dumbstruck, Inc.. The policy covers how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use or Services. When using any of our Services, you agree to the use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Please read the entire policy. It is very important to us that you understand what information we gather and what we do with that information.</p>

            <h3>Privacy Settings</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, we respect your right to privacy and will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information private and confidential as detailed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>It is important that you realize what your privacy options are when using our Services. There is only one privacy setting on the Dumbstruck application. It is your responsibility to ensure your application privacy settings coordinate with your privacy concerns.</p>
            <p><b>The default setting for &quot;Allow Content Sharing&quot; of your Dumbstruck messages and reactions to external websites and applications set to ON. <u>You must switch the sharing setting to OFF in order to prevent your contacts from sharing your reactions with others.</u></b></p>
            <p>As long as your privacy setting is turned OFF, your contacts will not be able to share your messages or reactions. We cannot, however, keep your contacts (or other people who have access to your contacts’ Dumbstruck accounts) from taking a screenshot of your messages/reactions and/or otherwise capturing your content and sharing it with others via electronic and print means.</p>

            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
            <p><b>Creating a Dumbstruck Account:</b> When you create a Dumbstruck account, you provide us with access to your name, email address, and mobile phone information including access to your contacts. We then link you to your contacts to let you know who in your contact list is also using the application. This is a convenient way for you to link to other users you know who have downloaded Dumbstruck. We will not save your contact list to our servers.</p>
            <p><b>Profile Information:</b> When you create a Dumbstruck account, we send you a welcome message via the app. When you open that message, your reaction is automatically recorded and a snapshot from that reaction is taken and used as your profile photo. You then have the ability to, if you wish, change your profile photo. By reacting to that first message and/or changing your profile photo, you provide us access to that photo.</p>
            <p>By using the app you also provide us with access to data regarding your profile settings, such as name, username, email, password, users you have blocked, and notification and email update settings.</p>
            <p><b>Information:</b> We may also ask for demographic information for our own market research purposes. This will allow us to tailor the Dumbstruck product to our users and provide an even better user experience. We may ask for this information when you register an account on the application and/or as part of updates to Dumbstruck that we rollout over time.</p>
            <p><b>Sending Messages and Reactions:</b> When you send a message to one of your contacts or react to a message that was sent to you, we collect, process, and store the contents of the message/reaction. The contents may include photos, videos, audio, captions, drawings, and any combination of those content types. The contents of the messages/reactions are also stored on the device of the sender and the reactor. Once a message has been reacted to, the message and reaction will automatically be deleted from our servers in 24 hours unless one of either the sender or reactor saves or shares the content. The message and reaction will also be deleted from all devices after 24 hours, unless either the sender or the reactor chooses to save the message/reaction. If saved, the message/reaction will remain on that specific device until the user chooses to delete it.</p>
            <p>Messages/reactions which are shared to external apps or sites (such as Facebook and Twitter), will still be deleted from devices after 24 hours unless specifically saved to those devices. Shared content will remain accessible via the shared link as well as via URL unless removed from the web by Dumbstruck, Inc. To remove shared content from the web, users must click the “Request Removal” link on the web page that contains the shared content. Final decision to remove content is made by Dumbstruck, Inc. As long as shared content remains on the web, it will remain on our servers.</p>
            <p>In addition, there may be ways for users to keep content without saving it on their devices or sharing it to the web. For instance, a user may take a screenshot of a message and/or a reaction. There is nothing we can do to stop users from taking such action. It is up to you to select who you are comfortable interacting with on Dumbstruck. If a user takes an action you are uncomfortable with, you can block or delete that user from your contacts.</p>
